# Just Skate

## Summary

In this Unreal Engine 4 project, I implemented the skateboard and skatepark assets that I created in Blender and Substance Painter into a skateboarding game. The player is given control of a skateboard and maneuvers it across the skatepark. The physics and mechanics system are not complete and I am currently struggling to implement the collisions for the skatepark mesh.
